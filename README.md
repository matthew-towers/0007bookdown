# MATH0007 course text

Course text for UCL's MATH0007 Algebra for Joint Honours Students, by me. A first year algebra course introducing sets, functions, relations, linear algebra, and group theory.

Made using R Markdown and bookdown, based on the minimal example (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).
